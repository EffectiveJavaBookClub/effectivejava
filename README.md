This repo implements the examples of Item 29, as well as how a generic list can be used to do the same thing. Item 29 explains that the reason MyStackGenericList isn't taught in the example is because "Java doesn't support lists natively, so some generic types such as ArrayList, must be implemented atop arrays."
